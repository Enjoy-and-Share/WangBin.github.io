Dr. Wang received the B.E. degree (with honors) in Automotive Engineering and his M.S. degree in Automotive Engineering from Wuhan University of Technology, China in 2009 and 2011, respectively. As a Joint Ph.D. student, he studied in Car Center, Ohio State University, USA from 2012 to 2014, and received the Ph.D. degree(with honors) in Automotive Engineering from Wuhan University of Technology in 2014.

Industrial Experience
======

Dr. Wang started his industrial career at SAIC MOTOR Group( the largest Automotive Group in China) in 2015 and was early promoted to Manager of ADAS application software team in 2018 and then very early promoted to Head of ADAS Product and System Dept.in 2021. He led the ADAS system development and feature algorithm in SAIC, and the ADAS products developed by SAIC had been mass-produced on more than 100 thousand of ROEWE and MG brand vehicles. 

In 2022, he left SAIC MOTOR and joined Shanghai BAOLONG Automotive Corporation as General Manager of R&D Center. Dr. Wang is in charge of the ADAS products development, including cameras, radars, and ADAS domain controllers,which makes over 100million in sale last year.

Academic Research
======
Dr. Wang has served as technical reviewer for the IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, Journal of the Franklin Institute, SAE International, IET Intelligent Transport Systems and Journal of Automobile Engineering. Dr. Wang is the author or co-author of more than 25 peer-reviewed publications including 13 journal articles and 12 patents.
